"The order arrives in our system and is directly sent to the chosen restaurant. After a few seconds the restaurant receives the order by fax, email or our own software T-Connect. If the restaurant has no connection, your order will be passed by phone by a member of our call center. This way you can always be sure that your order will be correctly sent to the chosen restaurant.Once the restaurant has received all the details of your order, it is their responsibility to prepare and deliver your meal. ReadyPizza is only responsible for the sending of the order, not for the final product (service, quality of the food and delivery).",2
